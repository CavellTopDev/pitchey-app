### 3. Demo Accounts
The tests use these demo accounts (password: `Demo123`):
- **Creator:** alex.creator@demo.com
- **Investor:** sarah.investor@demo.com  
- **Production:** stellar.production@demo.com

## Critical Fixes Validated

### 📈 Dashboard Loading Fix
**Issue:** Date serialization causing `JSON.stringify` errors
**Fix:** Proper Date object handling in Drizzle queries
**Test:** Dashboard endpoints load without errors

### 🔍 View Tracking Analytics
**Issue:** Raw SQL view tracking not converted
**Fix:** Drizzle ORM aggregation queries
**Test:** Demographics and time-series analytics work

### 🔐 Authentication Flow
**Issue:** User queries mixed raw SQL and ORM
**Fix:** Consistent Drizzle ORM usage
**Test:** All portal logins and JWT validation

### 📊 Complex Queries
**Issue:** Joins and aggregations in raw SQL
**Fix:** Drizzle query builder with proper typing
**Test:** Search, filtering, and analytics queries

### 🎬 Pitch Management
**Issue:** CRUD operations using raw SQL
**Fix:** Drizzle insert, update, delete operations
**Test:** Complete pitch lifecycle

## Test Results Interpretation

### Success Criteria
- **95%+ Pass Rate:** Conversion successful, production ready
- **80-95% Pass Rate:** Mostly successful, minor issues to address
- **<80% Pass Rate:** Significant issues requiring attention

### Key Metrics
- **Total Tests:** ~50-60 individual tests
- **Response Time:** API calls should be <2 seconds
- **Database Performance:** Simple queries <1 second
- **Date Serialization:** No JSON errors in responses

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend Not Running**
   ```bash
   # Start backend on correct port
   PORT=8001 deno run --allow-all working-server.ts
   ```

2. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify demo accounts exist in database
   - Check JWT_SECRET environment variable

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify Neon database connection string
   - Check database migrations are applied

4. **Permission Errors**
   ```bash
   # Make scripts executable
   chmod +x quick-drizzle-validation.sh
   ```

### Test Failures

1. **Date Serialization Errors**
   - Check Date handling in response formatting
   - Verify Drizzle Date field configuration

2. **Type Safety Failures** 
   - Review Drizzle schema definitions
   - Check enum value constraints

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Review query optimization
   - Check database indexing
