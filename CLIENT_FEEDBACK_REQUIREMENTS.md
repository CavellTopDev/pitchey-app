## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Priority 1)

### Investor Account Issues

#### 1. Sign-Out Functionality Broken
**Current State**: Investor accounts CANNOT sign out - button/functionality is completely broken

**Impact**: Security risk - users cannot properly log out  

**Technical Requirements**:
- Fix logout endpoint for investor portal
- Ensure JWT token is properly cleared
- Redirect to appropriate landing page after logout
- Test across all three user types (Creator, Investor, Production)

**Testing Criteria**:
- [ ] Investor can successfully sign out
- [ ] Session/JWT is cleared after sign out
- [ ] User is redirected to login page
- [ ] Cannot access protected routes after sign out

## üìÅ BROWSE PITCHES SECTION (Priority 2)

### Navigation & Filtering Issues

#### 1. Tab Content Separation
**Current State**: 
- "Trending" tab shows mixed content (trending + new)
- "New" tab also shows trending content
- "Top Rated" tab duplicates Trending functionality

**Required State**:
- "Trending" tab: ONLY trending pitches (based on views/engagement metrics)
- "New" tab: ONLY newest pitches (sorted by creation date descending)
- REMOVE "Top Rated" tab completely

**Implementation Notes**:
```typescript
// API endpoints should filter correctly:
GET /api/pitches/trending - Returns only trending pitches
GET /api/pitches/new - Returns only new pitches (last 30 days)
// Remove: GET /api/pitches/top-rated
```

#### 2. Genre & Format UI Enhancement
**Current State**: Basic text or limited UI for genre/format selection  
**Required State**: Dropdown/select UI matching the upload page design

**UI Requirements**:

#### 3. New General Browse View
**Current State**: Limited browsing options  
**Required State**: Comprehensive browse view with advanced sorting

- **Budget**: High to Low, Low to High
- **View Count**: Most Viewed, Least Viewed
- **Investment Status**: Funded, Seeking Funding, In Production

**Reference Pattern**: Similar to car shopping websites (filters on left, results on right)

### Current Bugs

#### Pitch Visibility Issue
**Bug Description**: Newly uploaded pitches not appearing in Browse section  
**Investigation Required**:

- Verify database write confirmation
- Check filtering logic excluding new pitches
- Review publish/draft status handling

#### Investor Pitch Creation Bug
**Current State**: Investors can create/upload pitches (appearing in browse)  
**Required State**: Investors should NOT have pitch creation capability

**Access Control Matrix**:
| User Type | Can Create Pitch | Can View Pitches | Can Invest |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| Creator | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| Investor | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Production | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |

---

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS

### Environment Setup
- Development: Full NDA workflow should work locally
- Staging: Test with mock payment/signing services
- Production: Integrate with legal e-signature provider

### Required Services
- Document storage (S3/similar for NDAs and documents)
- E-signature integration (DocuSign/HelloSign)
- Email notifications for NDA events
- Redis caching for browse performance

---

## üìù KNOWN LIMITATIONS & WORKAROUNDS

### Current Workarounds

1. **Investor Sign-out**: Use browser dev tools to clear localStorage/sessionStorage
2. **Character Editing**: Document order when adding, delete all and re-add in correct order
3. **NDA Workflow**: May need to test on staging/production environment
4. **Document Upload**: Use API directly via Postman/curl for testing

### Temporary Solutions
- Investor dashboard: Use creator dashboard as reference for required features
- Browse filtering: Apply filters manually in database queries
- NDA signing: Manual process via email until e-signature integrated

---

## üìû SUPPORT & QUESTIONS

### FAQ for Client

**Q: Does the NDA workflow need a live site?**
A: The NDA workflow should work in development, but e-signature integration may require staging/production environment with proper SSL certificates.

**Q: Why can't investors sign out?**
A: This is a critical bug in the logout endpoint specific to investor accounts. Temporary workaround is clearing browser data.

**Q: Why are new pitches not showing?**
A: Likely a caching issue. The system may be serving cached results. Cache invalidation needs to be triggered on new pitch creation.

**Q: Can we test the full workflow locally?**
A: Yes, except for third-party integrations (e-signature, email). These can be mocked in development.
