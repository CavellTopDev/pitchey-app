## üî¥ Priority 1 Issues

### Issue #1: Missing Database Tables
**Status:** CRITICAL - Platform Breaking  
**Impact:** Social features, notifications, and investment tracking completely non-functional

#### Problem Description
Multiple database tables referenced in the code do not exist in the actual database schema, causing widespread failures across user workflows.

#### Missing Tables
```sql
-- Social features table
follows (follower_id, following_id, created_at)

-- Investment tracking table  
portfolio (user_id, pitch_id, investment_amount, created_at)

-- Notifications system
notifications (user_id, type, title, message, is_read, created_at)

-- Analytics tracking
analytics_events (user_id, event_type, pitch_id, metadata, created_at)

-- NDA management
nda_requests (requester_id, pitch_id, creator_id, status, created_at)
```

#### Error Examples
```
NeonDbError: relation "follows" does not exist
NeonDbError: relation "portfolio" does not exist
```

#### Affected Features
- ‚ùå Social following system (completely broken)
- ‚ùå Investment portfolio tracking (completely broken)
- ‚ùå Notification system (completely broken)
- ‚ùå View/engagement analytics (completely broken)
- ‚ùå NDA request workflow (completely broken)

#### Fix Required
```sql
-- Execute these SQL commands in production database

CREATE TABLE follows (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    follower_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    following_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(follower_id, following_id)
);

CREATE TABLE portfolio (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    pitch_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES pitches(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    investment_amount DECIMAL(15,2),
    investment_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'active',
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    message TEXT,

### Issue #2: DATABASE_URL Configuration Problems
**Status:** CRITICAL - Content Creation Broken  
**Impact:** Users cannot create new pitches or content

#### Problem Description
The DATABASE_URL environment variable is not properly configured for some service contexts, causing pitch creation and other database write operations to fail.

#### Error Examples
```
Error creating pitch: Error: DATABASE_URL not configured
Database insert error: Error: DATABASE_URL not configured
```

#### Affected Features
- ‚ùå Pitch creation (all portals)
- ‚ùå Content management operations
- ‚ùå User profile updates
- ‚ùå New user registration

#### Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be in the PitchService.create() method and related database operations where the DATABASE_URL is not being passed correctly to the database client.

#### Fix Required
1. **Environment Variable Verification**
   ```bash
   # Ensure DATABASE_URL is set in all environments
   echo $DATABASE_URL
   ```

2. **Service Configuration Fix**
   ```typescript
   // In src/services/pitch.service.ts and related services
   // Ensure database client is properly initialized with DATABASE_URL
   
   const client = new Client({
     connectionString: Deno.env.get("DATABASE_URL"),
   });
   ```

3. **Deno Deploy Configuration**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is set in Deno Deploy dashboard
   - Ensure .env.deploy file includes DATABASE_URL
   - Test deployment with proper environment variables

‚ùå Failed to invalidate trending cache: TypeError: this.redis.keys is not a function
‚ùå Draft sync cleanup failed: ReferenceError: nativeRedisService is not defined
```

#### Affected Features
- ‚ùå Real-time dashboard updates
- ‚ùå Caching system (degraded performance)
- ‚ùå WebSocket live features
- ‚ùå Draft auto-sync functionality
- ‚ùå Live notifications

#### Root Cause Analysis
The nativeRedisService is not being properly imported or initialized in several service files.

#### Fix Required
1. **Service Import Fix**
   ```typescript
   // In src/services/dashboard-cache.service.ts
   // In src/services/draft-sync.service.ts
   // In src/services/notification.service.ts
   
   import { redisService } from "./redis.service.ts";
   
   // Replace nativeRedisService references with proper service
   private static get redis() { 
     return redisService; 
   }
   ```

2. **Redis Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Local development
   docker run -d --name pitchey-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine
   
   # Production environment variable
   REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@host:port

# Test portfolio creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/investor/portfolio \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"pitchId":1,"amount":50000}'

# Test notifications
curl http://localhost:8001/api/notifications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### After Configuration Fix
```bash
# Test pitch creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/pitches \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Pitch","genre":"drama","format":"feature"}'

# Test cache functionality
curl http://localhost:8001/api/ws/health
```

## Risk Assessment

2. **Staging Environment**: Test all fixes in staging first
3. **Rollback Plan**: Prepared rollback procedures for each fix
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring during fix deployment

## Success Metrics

### After Priority 1 Fixes
- ‚úÖ Users can create new pitches successfully
- ‚úÖ Social following system functional
- ‚úÖ Investment tracking operational
- ‚úÖ Real-time features working
- ‚úÖ No critical database errors in logs

### After All Fixes
- ‚úÖ All three user portals fully functional

- ‚úÖ Platform ready for user acceptance testing
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics within acceptable ranges

## Conclusion

The Pitchey platform has excellent architecture and is significantly more complete than initially documented. The critical issues identified are primarily infrastructure-related rather than fundamental design problems, making them solvable with focused technical effort.

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Create missing database tables (2-4 hours)
2. Fix DATABASE_URL configuration (4-8 hours)  
3. Initialize Redis services properly (2-4 hours)

Once these Priority 1 issues are resolved, the platform should be capable of supporting full user workflows across all three portals and can proceed to user acceptance testing.
