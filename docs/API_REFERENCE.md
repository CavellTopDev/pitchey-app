## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting based on endpoint type:

- **General API**: 100 requests/minute
- **Authentication**: 10 requests/minute
- **File Upload**: 10 requests/minute
- **Sensitive Operations** (investments, NDAs): 5 requests/minute

Rate limit headers are included in responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Reset timestamp

## Error Responses

All errors follow a consistent format:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

Common error codes:
- `UNAUTHORIZED`: Authentication required
- `FORBIDDEN`: Insufficient permissions
- `NOT_FOUND`: Resource not found
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Input validation failed
- `RATE_LIMITED`: Rate limit exceeded
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`: Server error

## CORS Configuration

The API supports CORS with the following configuration:
- **Allowed Origins**: https://pitchey-5o8.pages.dev, http://localhost:5173
- **Allowed Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS
- **Allowed Headers**: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With
- **Credentials**: Supported (for cookie-based sessions)

## Migration Notes

### From JWT to Better Auth
The platform has migrated from JWT-based authentication to Better Auth's session-based system. Key changes:

1. **Sessions stored in cookies** - No need to send Authorization headers
2. **JWT still supported** - For backward compatibility
3. **Portal endpoints work** - All portal-specific endpoints route through Better Auth
4. **Demo accounts unchanged** - Same credentials, now work with Better Auth

### WebSocket to Polling
Due to free tier limitations, WebSocket functionality has been replaced with efficient polling:

1. **Combined endpoints** - `/api/poll/all` returns multiple data types
2. **Smart caching** - Results cached for 5-30 seconds based on data type
3. **Reduced requests** - Single poll replaces multiple WebSocket subscriptions

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented (117+ endpoints)
- All authentication endpoints
- Creator, Investor, and Production dashboards
- Pitch CRUD operations
- NDA workflow
- File upload system
- Search and browse
- Team management
- User settings
- Analytics endpoints
- Notification system
- Follow system
- Investment tracking

### ⚠️ Partial Implementation
- WebSocket support (disabled on free tier, polling available)
- Email/messaging routes (commented out due to Drizzle ORM issues)
- Some advanced production features pending full data

### 🔧 Known Limitations (Free Tier)
- WebSocket connections return 503
- Polling used instead of real-time updates
- Rate limiting enforced
- Some caching delays (5-30 seconds)
