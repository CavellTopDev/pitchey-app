## 🚀 How Crawl4AI Completes the Missing 15%

### Integration Plan Using Crawl4AI Skills

#### 1. **Industry Data Enrichment** (Addresses: Pitch Validation)
```python
# Location: crawl4ai/scripts/pitch_enrichment.py
# Using: extraction_pipeline.py pattern

# Step 1: Generate schemas for industry sites
python extraction_pipeline.py --generate-schema https://imdb.com "extract movie data"
python extraction_pipeline.py --generate-schema https://boxofficemojo.com "extract revenue data"

# Step 2: Auto-enrich pitch submissions
async def enrich_pitch(pitch_data):
    # Search for comparable films
    comparable_results = await crawler.arun(
        f"https://imdb.com/search?q={pitch_data['genre']}+{pitch_data['keywords']}"
    )
    # Extract budget ranges, success metrics
    return enriched_data
```

#### 2. **Market Intelligence Feed** (Addresses: Dashboard Content)
```python
# Location: crawl4ai/scripts/market_intelligence.py
# Pattern: batch_crawler.py for concurrent processing

news_sources = [
    "https://variety.com/film/",
    "https://hollywoodreporter.com/movies/",
    "https://deadline.com/film/"
]

# Daily automated crawl for trending topics
results = await crawler.arun_many(
    urls=news_sources,
    config=CrawlerRunConfig(
        fit_markdown=True,
        fit_markdown_options={"query": "film financing streaming deals"}
    )
)
```

#### 3. **Legal Document Templates** (Addresses: NDA Workflow)
```python
# Location: crawl4ai/scripts/legal_scraper.py
# Extract standard NDA clauses from legal sites

schema = {
    "name": "nda_clauses",
    "baseSelector": ".legal-content",
    "fields": [
        {"name": "clause_title", "selector": "h3", "type": "text"},
        {"name": "clause_text", "selector": "p.clause", "type": "text"},
        {"name": "jurisdiction", "selector": ".jurisdiction", "type": "text"}
    ]
}

# Build customizable NDA template library
```

#### 4. **Competitor Analysis** (Addresses: Competitive Positioning)
```python
# Location: crawl4ai/scripts/competitor_monitor.py
# Monitor competing platforms for features and pricing

competitors = ["slated.com", "stage32.com", "filmhub.com"]

# Weekly analysis of competitor features
async def analyze_competitors():
    for competitor in competitors:
        result = await crawler.arun(
            f"https://{competitor}/features",
            config=CrawlerRunConfig(
                extraction_strategy=JsonCssExtractionStrategy(competitor_schema)
            )
        )
        # Compare features, identify gaps
```
