// Test critical user flows
test('Creator can create and publish pitch', async ({ page }) => {
  // Login → Dashboard → Create → Fill form → Publish → Verify
});

test('Investor can request NDA', async ({ page }) => {
  // Login → Browse → Select pitch → Request NDA → Verify pending
});

test('Creator can approve NDA', async ({ page }) => {
  // Login → Dashboard → NDAs → Approve → Verify investor can access
});
```

### Analytics Events to Track
```javascript
// Track these events in Axiom/Analytics
'pitch_created'
'pitch_published'
'nda_requested'
'nda_approved'
'nda_rejected'
'document_downloaded'
'investment_expressed'
'message_sent'
```
