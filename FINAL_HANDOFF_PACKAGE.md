## 🏗️ Swap-Ready Architecture

The platform uses a sophisticated abstraction layer that allows switching from development to production services with **only environment variable changes**:

### Email Service
```bash
# Development (Current)
EMAIL_PROVIDER=console

# Production (When Ready)
EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-key
```
**Switch Time**: 5 minutes

### Storage Service
```bash
# Development (Current)
STORAGE_PROVIDER=local

# Production (When Ready)
STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
```
**Switch Time**: 10 minutes

### Payment Service
```bash
# Development (Current)
PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock

# Production (When Ready)
PAYMENT_PROVIDER=stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_xxx
```
**Switch Time**: 15 minutes

**Total Production Setup Time**: 2-3 hours
