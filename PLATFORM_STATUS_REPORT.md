### üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STATUS

#### Live URLs
- Frontend: https://pitchey-frontend.fly.dev ‚úÖ
- Backend: https://pitchey-backend.fly.dev ‚úÖ

#### Deployment Configuration
- Frontend: React app served via Nginx
- Backend: Deno server on port 8000
- Both apps auto-scale with min 0 machines
- CORS configured for cross-origin requests

### üìù NEXT STEPS FOR COMPLETION

#### Priority 1: Authentication (Required for all other features)
1. Implement proper user registration with database storage
2. Add login endpoints for all three portals
3. Fix JWT token generation and validation
4. Add session management and refresh tokens

#### Priority 2: Database Implementation
1. Set up PostgreSQL or MongoDB
2. Create schemas for users, pitches, investments
3. Implement proper CRUD operations
4. Add data validation and constraints

#### Priority 3: Core Features
1. Enable pitch creation and editing
2. Implement investment workflow
3. Add basic messaging functionality
4. Create NDA management system

#### Priority 4: File Handling
1. Set up file upload system (S3 or similar)
2. Add media processing pipeline
3. Implement document storage
4. Add file size and type validation

#### Priority 5: Production Readiness
1. Add proper error logging
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Set up monitoring and alerts
4. Add automated testing
5. Configure backups

### üí° RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Focus**: Fix authentication to unlock all protected features
2. **Database First**: Implement persistent storage before adding features
3. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy each feature as completed
4. **Testing Strategy**: Add tests for each new endpoint
5. **Security Audit**: Review all endpoints before production launch

### üìà ESTIMATED TIMELINE

To reach MVP status with basic functionality:
- **Week 1-2**: Authentication & Database Setup
- **Week 3-4**: Core CRUD Operations
- **Week 5-6**: Investment & Messaging Features
- **Week 7-8**: File Upload & NDA Management
- **Week 9-10**: Testing & Production Hardening

### üéØ CONCLUSION

The platform successfully demonstrates its concept with comprehensive mock data and a polished frontend. The viewing experience is fully functional, allowing users to browse pitches and understand the platform's value proposition. However, all interactive features requiring authentication or data persistence are currently non-functional.

**Current State**: Demo/Prototype
**Target State**: Production MVP
**Estimated Effort**: 8-10 weeks of development
**Critical Path**: Authentication ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Core Features

The foundation is solid, but significant backend development is required to make the platform operational for real users.
