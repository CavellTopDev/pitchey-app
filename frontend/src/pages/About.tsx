              Pitchey was born out of frustration. Mine, mostly.

              As a producer, I was always looking for the next great idea. But there was nowhere simple, 
              central, or sane for people to pitch their projects. Instead, I'd get pitches sent in every 
              format under the sun: PDFs, Word docs, Google links, pitch decks that looked like they 
              were designed in the early 2000s. Half the time I couldn't even open them properly, and the 
              other half I'd lose them forever in the black hole that is my inbox.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Meanwhile, creators had the opposite problem. No clear place to send their ideas, no way 
              to stand out, and no guarantee their pitch wouldn't just sink to the bottom of someone's 
              email pile.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              So I thought: what if there was a single place where pitches actually lived? Organized, 
              searchable, easy to send, easy to read, and impossible to lose. A place built for creators, 
              producers, and investors who all want the same thing: great stories.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800">
              That's Pitchey.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think of it as the world's least annoying inbox, a marketplace where projects and people 
              actually find each other.
