# Cloudflare Pages _redirects file for SPA routing
# This ensures all routes are handled by React Router instead of returning 404

# Exclude specific paths from the catch-all redirect
/api/*    /api/:splat   200
/assets/*    /assets/:splat   200  
/images/*    /images/:splat   200

# Handle all other routes by serving index.html (SPA fallback)
# This must come last to avoid matching the excluded paths above
/*    /index.html   200!
