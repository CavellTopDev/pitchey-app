# Pitchey Platform Testing Report

**Test Date:** September 23, 2025  
**Platform URL:** https://pitchey-frontend.deno.dev  
**Backend Server:** localhost:8000 (working-server.ts)  
**Testing Scope:** Comprehensive platform analysis including routes, API endpoints, authentication, and data flow  

## Executive Summary

The Pitchey platform has been thoroughly tested across all three user portals (Creator, Investor, Production). While the platform architecture is well-designed and many core features are functional, there are significant authentication inconsistencies and missing API implementations that impact user experience.

**Overall Status:** 🟡 Partially Functional - Core features work but with critical authentication issues

## 2. Authentication System Analysis

### 🟢 Working Authentication
- **Creator Login:** ✅ `POST /api/auth/creator/login`
- **Investor Login:** ✅ `POST /api/auth/investor/login`  
- **Production Login:** ✅ `POST /api/auth/production/login`

### 🔴 Critical Authentication Issues

**Issue:** **Inconsistent Authentication Systems**  
The platform has two conflicting authentication mechanisms:

1. **JWT Token System** (used by login endpoints)
   - Login endpoints return JWT tokens
   - Format: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
   - Contains: `{userId, sessionId, exp}`

2. **Session-based System** (expected by most endpoints)
   - Uses `AuthService.verifySession(token)`
   - Expects different token format/validation

**Impact:** Most protected endpoints fail with "Unauthorized" or "No authorization header" errors despite valid JWT tokens.

### Authentication Test Results

| Endpoint | Auth Method | Status | Token Type Expected |
|----------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| Login endpoints | JWT generation | ✅ Working | N/A |
| Creator dashboard | inline auth check | ✅ Working | JWT |
| Investor dashboard | inline auth check | ✅ Working | JWT |
| Production dashboard | inline auth check | ✅ Working | JWT |
| Profile endpoint | `authenticate()` function | ❌ Failing | Session token |
| Pitches endpoints | `authenticate()` function | ❌ Failing | Session token |
| Messages endpoints | `authenticate()` function | ❌ Failing | Session token |
| NDA endpoints | `authenticate()` function | ❌ Failing | Session token |
| Payment endpoints | `authenticate()` function | ❌ Failing | Session token |

## 3. API Endpoint Testing Results

### 🟢 Working Endpoints (4 endpoints)

#### Dashboard Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /api/creator/dashboard` - Returns comprehensive creator stats, activity, and notifications
- ✅ `GET /api/investor/dashboard` - Returns portfolio, investments, recommendations, and watchlist  
- ✅ `GET /api/production/dashboard` - Returns projects, resources, deadlines, and performance metrics
- ✅ `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

#### Individual Pitch Viewing
- ✅ `GET /api/pitches/{id}` - Returns detailed pitch information with comprehensive metadata

### 🔴 Failing Endpoints (Authentication Issues)

All endpoints using the `authenticate()` function fail due to JWT/Session token mismatch:

## 4. Frontend-Backend API Mismatch Analysis

### Frontend API Client Usage

The frontend uses multiple API client patterns:

1. **api.ts** - Original axios-based client with JWT token handling
2. **api-client.ts** - Newer robust client with better error handling  
3. **apiServices.ts** - Service layer combining both approaches
4. **Direct fetch calls** - For specific use cases like file uploads

### Expected vs Available Endpoints

|---------------------|----------------------|--------|-------|
| `/api/auth/{type}/login` | ✅ Implemented | ✅ Working | All three portals work |
| `/api/profile` | ✅ Implemented | ❌ Auth issues | Uses wrong auth method |
| `/api/pitches` (CRUD) | ✅ Implemented | ❌ Auth issues | Full CRUD exists but blocked |
| `/api/public/pitches` | ❌ Returns error | ❌ Broken | Service implementation issue |
| `/api/ndas/*` | ✅ Implemented | ❌ Auth issues | Full NDA system exists |
| `/api/messages/*` | ✅ Implemented | ❌ Auth issues | WebSocket messaging exists |
| `/api/payments/*` | ✅ Implemented | ❌ Auth issues | Stripe integration exists |
| `/api/ai/*` | ❌ Not found | ❌ Missing | AI features not implemented |
| `/api/follows/*` | ❌ Partially | 🟡 Incomplete | Some endpoints missing |
