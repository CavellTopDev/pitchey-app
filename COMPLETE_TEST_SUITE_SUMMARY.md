## 🚀 How to Run All Tests

### Individual Test Suites:
```bash
# Payment Tests
./test-payment-workflows.sh

# Security Tests
./test-security-workflows.sh

# Messaging Tests
./test-messaging-workflows.sh

# File Upload Tests
./test-file-upload-workflows.sh

# Search Tests
./test-search-workflows.sh
```

### Run All Critical Tests:
```bash
# Create a master test runner
cat > run-all-critical-tests.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

echo "Running All Critical Test Suites..."
echo "=================================="

./test-payment-workflows.sh
./test-security-workflows.sh
./test-messaging-workflows.sh
./test-file-upload-workflows.sh
./test-search-workflows.sh

echo "All Critical Tests Complete!"
EOF

chmod +x run-all-critical-tests.sh
./run-all-critical-tests.sh
```
