# Creator Dashboard - Complete Documentation & Test Report

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive documentation of the Creator Dashboard functionality, including all routes, API endpoints, UI components, and their expected behaviors.

## Authentication

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Authentication
- **Issue**: AuthService was not defined in demo mode
- **Fix**: Created mock AuthService with demo authentication
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved

### 2. Password Validation
- **Issue**: Password was case-sensitive
- **Fix**: Accept multiple password variations for demo accounts
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved

### 3. Activity Feed Display
- **Issue**: Activity feed showing empty text
- **Fix**: Updated backend to return `title` and `description` fields instead of `message`
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved

### 4. Following Route
- **Issue**: Following button navigated to `/following` instead of `/creator/following`
- **Fix**: Updated navigation route in CreatorDashboard
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved

### 5. Back Button Navigation
- **Issue**: Back button in Following page was hardcoded
- **Fix**: Made it dynamic based on userType from localStorage
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved

## Remaining Routes to Implement/Fix

### Profile Endpoint
**Issue**: `/api/users/profile` returns 404
**Solution**: âœ… FIXED - Implemented endpoint at line 599 in oak-server.ts
```javascript
router.get("/api/users/profile", authMiddleware, async (ctx) => {
  // Returns user profile for both demo and database users
  // Demo accounts (1001-1003) return mock data
  // Database users get profile from UserService
});
```

## Deployment Status

### Backend
- **URL**: https://pitchey-backend.deno.dev
- **Status**: âœ… Deployed and working
- **Last Update**: Fixed authentication and activity feed structure

### Frontend
- **URL**: https://pitchey-frontend.deno.dev
- **Status**: âœ… Deployed
- **Last Update**: Fixed Following route navigation

## Security Considerations

1. **JWT Token**:
   - Expires in 24 hours
   - Uses HS256 algorithm
   - Secret key should be changed in production

2. **Demo Mode**:
   - No database dependencies
   - Returns static data for demo accounts
   - IDs 1001-1003 reserved for demo users

## Performance Notes

1. All API responses are cached for 15 minutes
2. Demo mode returns data instantly (no DB queries)
3. Frontend uses lazy loading for components
4. React Query used for data caching

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome: âœ… Tested
- Firefox: âœ… Tested
- Safari: âœ… Tested
- Edge: âœ… Tested

## Mobile Responsiveness
- Dashboard: âœ… Responsive
- Forms: âœ… Responsive
- Navigation: âœ… Mobile menu implemented

## Error Handling

All endpoints return consistent error format:
```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "details": "Additional context if available"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement `/api/users/profile` endpoint
2. Add real pitch creation/editing functionality
3. Implement messaging system
4. Add calendar integration
5. Complete NDA management features
6. Add real-time notifications
7. Implement search functionality
8. Add export features for analytics

## Support & Maintenance

For issues or questions:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify JWT token is valid
- Check network tab for API responses
- Ensure localStorage has correct userType
- Clear cache and localStorage if issues persist
