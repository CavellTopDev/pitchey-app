# Storage Configuration Summary

## Overview
The upload service has been configured to automatically use local file storage when AWS credentials are not provided, eliminating S3-related errors and ensuring proper file upload/delete functionality.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Automatic Storage Provider Detection
```typescript
// Checks for AWS credentials automatically
const HAS_AWS_CREDENTIALS = !!(
  Deno.env.get("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID") && 
  Deno.env.get("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY") && 
  Deno.env.get("AWS_S3_BUCKET")
);

// Forces local storage when credentials unavailable
const STORAGE_PROVIDER = HAS_AWS_CREDENTIALS ? 
  (Deno.env.get("STORAGE_PROVIDER") || "hybrid") : 
  "local";
```

### 2. Safe S3 Client Initialization
- S3 client only initialized when credentials are available
- All S3 operations check for client availability before execution
- Graceful fallback to local storage

### 3. Enhanced File Deletion Logic
- Properly detects local vs S3 files
- Handles multiple file path formats
- Clear logging for debugging
- Prevents S3 deletion attempts without credentials

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Clear error messages when S3 unavailable
- Graceful degradation for S3-specific features
- Comprehensive logging throughout

## File Storage Structure

### Local Storage
```
./static/uploads/
├── media/           # General media uploads
├── pitches/         # Pitch-related documents
└── [folder]/        # Dynamic folders based on upload type
```

### File URL Format
- Local files: `/static/uploads/[folder]/[timestamp]-[uuid]-[filename]`
- Served directly by backend static file handler

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
- `STORAGE_PROVIDER`: "local", "s3", or "hybrid" (auto-detected if AWS available)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key (optional)
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key (optional)
- `AWS_S3_BUCKET`: S3 bucket name (optional)
- `USE_LOCAL_FALLBACK`: Always true for reliability

### Behavior Matrix
| AWS Credentials | STORAGE_PROVIDER | Actual Behavior |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| ❌ Not Set      | Any             | Local Storage   |
| ✅ Set         | "local"         | Local Storage   |
| ✅ Set         | "s3"            | S3 Storage      |
| ✅ Set         | "hybrid"        | S3 with fallback|

## API Endpoints Affected

### Upload Endpoints
- `POST /api/media/upload` - General file upload
- `POST /api/pitches/upload-document` - Pitch document upload

### File Serving
- `GET /static/uploads/*` - Static file serving

### File Management
- Document deletion via pitch management endpoints

## Benefits

### 1. Zero Configuration Startup
- Works immediately without AWS setup
- No S3 bucket errors on startup
- Seamless development experience

### 2. Automatic Scaling
- Can easily add S3 later by setting environment variables
- Hybrid mode provides redundancy
- Local fallback ensures reliability

### 3. Clear Error Handling
- Descriptive error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive logging

### 4. Security
- Local files served through controlled endpoint
- Path traversal protection
- File type validation

## Testing

### Test Coverage
✅ File upload to local storage  
✅ File deletion from local storage  
✅ Directory auto-creation  
✅ File validation  
✅ S3 method graceful failure  
✅ File serving via static endpoint  

### Test Command
```bash
deno run --allow-all test-upload-service-local.ts
```

## Monitoring & Logs

### Upload Service Logs
- Storage provider detection
- File operation success/failure
- Path resolution debugging
- S3 availability status

### Log Examples
```
Upload Service: Using local storage (AWS credentials available: false)
Upload Service: Deleting local file: ./static/uploads/pitches/file.pdf
Upload Service: Successfully deleted local file: ./static/uploads/pitches/file.pdf
```

## Production Recommendations

### For MVP/Development
- Use local storage (current configuration)
- Monitor disk usage
- Implement log rotation

### For Scale
- Add AWS credentials
- Set STORAGE_PROVIDER="hybrid"
- Configure CloudFront CDN
- Enable S3 monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission errors**: Ensure write access to `./static/uploads/`
2. **Disk space**: Monitor available storage
3. **File not found**: Check static file serving configuration

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check uploads directory
ls -la ./static/uploads/

# Test upload service
deno run --allow-all test-upload-service-local.ts

# Check file serving
curl http://localhost:8001/static/uploads/media/test-file.txt
```

## Files Modified
- `/src/services/upload.service.ts` - Main upload service
- `/working-server.ts` - Upload endpoints (no changes needed)
- `/test-upload-service-local.ts` - Verification test

This configuration ensures reliable file upload/delete functionality without requiring AWS credentials, while maintaining the ability to easily upgrade to S3 storage when needed.
