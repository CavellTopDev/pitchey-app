  pitch_id INTEGER REFERENCES pitches(id),
  investor_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  creator_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  nda_type VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  signed_at TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create info request tables
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS info_requests (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  nda_id INTEGER REFERENCES nda_requests(id),
  pitch_id INTEGER REFERENCES pitches(id),
  requester_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  question TEXT,
  response TEXT,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
