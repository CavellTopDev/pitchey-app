1. **Analysis** - Identified root cause using debugging agents
2. **Implementation** - Applied fixes using specialized development agents
3. **Verification** - Created test suites to confirm fixes
4. **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides for each feature

**Verification**: Created logout test that now passes  
**Result**: âœ… Investors can now sign out properly

#### 2. "Investor Dashboard Still Not Working!"
**Client Problem**: Dashboard showing error message

**Verification**: Dashboard now loads with portfolio data  
**Result**: âœ… Dashboard fully functional with all metrics

### BROWSE SECTION PROBLEMS

#### 3. "Tabs Showing Mixed Content"

  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Only creators can upload pitches' });
}
```
**UI Changes**: Removed "Create Pitch" buttons for investors/production
