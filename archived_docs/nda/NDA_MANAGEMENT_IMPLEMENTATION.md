# NDA Management Interface Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a comprehensive NDA management interface in the Production Dashboard that clearly shows all NDA workflows across 4 distinct categories.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. NDAManagementPanel Component (`/frontend/src/components/NDAManagementPanel.tsx`)
A reusable, feature-rich component that handles different NDA workflow views:

**Features:**
- **4 Category Support**: Incoming signed, outgoing signed, incoming requests, outgoing requests
- **Search & Filtering**: Search by pitch title, company, or person; filter by status and NDA type
- **Status Badges**: Visual indicators for pending, approved, rejected, signed, expired
- **Type Badges**: Basic, Enhanced, Custom NDA types with color coding
- **Expiration Warnings**: Highlights NDAs expiring within 30 days
- **User Type Icons**: Different icons for production companies, investors, creators
- **Quick Actions**: Approve/reject for incoming requests, view pitch, download NDA
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

### 2. Enhanced ProductionDashboard (`/frontend/src/pages/ProductionDashboard.tsx`)

**Updated NDAs Tab with:**
- **Management Center Header**: Clear overview with quick stats
- **4 Distinct Sections**:
  1. **Incoming NDA Requests** - Others wanting to access your pitches (with approve/reject actions)
  2. **NDAs Signed for Your Pitches** - Who has access to your content
  3. **Your Signed NDAs** - Pitches you have access to
  4. **Your Pending Requests** - Your requests awaiting approval

- **Additional Tools**:
  - Custom NDA Templates upload
  - NDA Analytics with approval rates
  - Quick stats overview

### 3. Enhanced Backend Endpoints (`/multi-portal-server.ts`)

**New Categorized Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/ndas/incoming-signed` - NDAs others signed for your pitches
- `GET /api/ndas/outgoing-signed` - NDAs you signed for others' pitches  
- `GET /api/ndas/incoming-requests` - Pending requests for your pitches
- `GET /api/ndas/outgoing-requests` - Your pending requests

**Features:**
- Proper filtering by user ID and pitch ownership
- Mock ownership logic for demonstration
- Consistent data structure across endpoints
- Error handling and validation

### 4. Updated API Services (`/frontend/src/lib/apiServices.ts`)

**New Methods:**
- `getIncomingSignedNDAs()` - Fetch signed NDAs for user's pitches
- `getOutgoingSignedNDAs()` - Fetch NDAs user signed
- `getIncomingRequests()` - Fetch incoming NDA requests
- `getOutgoingRequests()` - Fetch outgoing NDA requests

## Visual Design

### Color Coding System
- **Incoming Requests**: Amber/Orange gradient (urgent attention needed)
- **Incoming Signed NDAs**: Blue gradient (access granted to your content)
- **Outgoing Signed NDAs**: Green gradient (access you have)
- **Outgoing Requests**: Yellow (pending responses)

### Status Indicators
- **Pending**: Yellow with Clock icon
- **Approved**: Green with CheckCircle icon
- **Rejected**: Red with XCircle icon
- **Signed**: Blue with Shield icon
- **Expired**: Gray with AlertTriangle icon

### User Type Indicators
- **Production Company**: Purple with Building2 icon
- **Investor**: Green with DollarSign icon
- **Creator**: Gray with User icon

## Data Flow

1. **Dashboard Load**: Fetches all 4 categories of NDA data in parallel
2. **Real-time Updates**: Actions (approve/reject) immediately update the UI
3. **Search & Filter**: Client-side filtering for immediate response
4. **Navigation**: Direct links to view pitches and download NDAs

## Usage Examples

### For Production Companies
- **Monitor Access**: See who has signed NDAs for your pitches
- **Handle Requests**: Approve or reject incoming NDA requests quickly
- **Track Your Access**: View all pitches you have NDA access to
- **Manage Workflow**: Track pending requests you've made

### Key Workflows Supported
1. **Incoming Request Management**: View → Review → Approve/Reject
2. **Access Monitoring**: Track who has access to your content
3. **Your Access Tracking**: Manage pitches you can view
4. **Request Status**: Monitor your pending requests
