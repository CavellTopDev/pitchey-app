## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/pages/PublicPitchView.tsx`
  - Added `ndaRequestStatus` state tracking
  - Added `checkNDAStatus` function to query backend
  - Updated button rendering with conditional states
  - Added status message boxes

- `/frontend/src/services/nda.service.ts`
  - Already has `getNDAStatus` method for checking request status

### Backend Integration
The button states are linked to actual backend data through:
- `getNDAStatus(pitchId)` - Checks if user has existing NDA and its status
- `canRequestNDA(pitchId)` - Checks if user can request a new NDA
- NDA status values: 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected', 'expired', 'revoked'

## Demo Accounts
All use password: **Demo123**

- **Creator**: alex.creator@demo.com

## Troubleshooting

### Rate Limiting
If you see "Too many requests" errors:
1. Wait 60 seconds
2. Or restart the backend server:
   ```bash
   # Kill current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Restart
   PORT=8001 JWT_SECRET="test-secret-key-for-development" DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/pitchey" deno run --allow-all working-server.ts
   ```

### NDA Not Showing Different States
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify you're logged in with the correct account type
3. Check that the backend server is running on port 8001
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

## Summary
The NDA button now provides clear visual feedback about request status, preventing confusion and repeated clicking. Users can immediately see whether their request is pending, approved, or rejected, creating a better user experience.
