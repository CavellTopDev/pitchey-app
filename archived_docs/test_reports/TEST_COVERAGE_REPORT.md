## Critical Missing Tests

### HIGH PRIORITY (Security/Financial Risk)
1. **Payment Processing** - No tests for Stripe integration
2. **File Upload Security** - No validation tests
3. **Authentication Security** - No password reset/email verification tests
4. **Data Privacy** - No GDPR compliance tests
5. **XSS/CSRF Protection** - No security vulnerability tests

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (User Experience)
1. **Search Functionality** - Complete search system untested
2. **Messaging System** - Real-time messaging completely untested
3. **File Management** - Media upload/management untested
4. **Email Notifications** - No email delivery tests
5. **Mobile Responsiveness** - No responsive design tests

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)
1. **Admin Dashboard** - Admin features untested
2. **Analytics Export** - Report generation untested
3. **User Preferences** - Settings management untested
4. **Help/Support** - Support system untested

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Create Payment Test Suite**
   - Test Stripe webhook handling
   - Test payment processing flows
   - Test subscription management
   - Test refund processes

2. **Create Security Test Suite**
   - Test authentication vulnerabilities
   - Test file upload restrictions
   - Test XSS prevention
   - Test SQL injection prevention

3. **Create Messaging Test Suite**
   - Test WebSocket connections
   - Test real-time message delivery
   - Test file attachments
   - Test conversation management

### Test Framework Improvements
1. **Implement E2E Testing**
   - Add Playwright or Cypress for UI testing
   - Create user journey tests
   - Add visual regression testing

2. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Frontend component testing with Vitest
   - Service layer testing
   - Utility function testing

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing with k6 or JMeter
   - API response time monitoring
   - Database query optimization tests

## Test Coverage Metrics

### Current Coverage
- **Authentication:** 60% ✅
- **Pitch Management:** 40% ⚠️
- **NDA System:** 50% ⚠️
- **Social Features:** 20% ❌
- **Messaging:** 0% ❌
- **Payments:** 0% ❌
- **Search:** 0% ❌
- **File Management:** 0% ❌
- **Analytics:** 15% ❌
- **Admin:** 0% ❌

### Overall Coverage: ~25% of all workflows

## Conclusion

While the existing test suite covers core authentication and basic workflows well, there are significant gaps in testing for:
1. Financial transactions (HIGH RISK)
2. Security features (HIGH RISK)
3. Real-time features (messaging, notifications)
4. Advanced features (search, analytics)
5. File handling and media management

**Recommendation:** Before production deployment, prioritize creating tests for payment processing, security features, and the messaging system as these represent the highest risk areas for user experience and platform security.
