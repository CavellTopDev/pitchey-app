- Detailed results tracking and reporting
- Performance metrics collection
- Failure analysis and debugging support
- Final recommendations based on results

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run all comprehensive tests
./run-comprehensive-test-suite.sh

# Show help
./run-comprehensive-test-suite.sh --help
```

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

1. **API Server**: Running on port 8001
   ```bash
   PORT=8001 JWT_SECRET="test-secret-key" DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/pitchey" deno run --allow-all working-server.ts
   ```

2. **Frontend Server**: Running on port 5173 (optional for some tests)
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

3. **Database**: PostgreSQL accessible with test data
   ```bash
   PGPASSWORD=password psql -h localhost -U postgres -d pitchey
   ```

4. **Required Utilities**:
   - `curl` - HTTP requests
   - `jq` - JSON processing
   - `bc` - Mathematical calculations

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Demo Data**: Ensure demo accounts are available
2. **Test Files**: Upload test files should be present in `test-uploads/`
3. **Database State**: Clean state with proper schema
4. **Network Access**: API and frontend accessible

## Running Tests

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Run specific test suite
./test-e2e-user-journeys.sh
./test-performance-load.sh
./test-investment-tracking.sh
./test-production-company-features.sh
./test-mobile-responsive.sh
```

### Complete Test Suite

```bash
# Run all tests with comprehensive reporting
./run-comprehensive-test-suite.sh
```

### Expected Output

Each test suite provides:
- Real-time progress indicators
- Pass/fail status for each test
- Performance metrics where applicable
- Detailed error messages for failures
- Summary report with recommendations

## Test Data Management

### Test Users Created

Each test suite creates its own test users with timestamp-based email addresses:
- `creator_[timestamp]@test.com`
- `investor_[timestamp]@test.com`
- `production_[timestamp]@test.com`

### Data Cleanup

- Test data is self-contained and identified by timestamps
- No automatic cleanup to allow for debugging
- Manual cleanup can be performed by searching for timestamp-based records

### Data Integrity

- All tests verify data integrity at completion
- Cross-references ensure relational consistency
- Mathematical calculations are verified against expected results

## Continuous Integration

### CI/CD Integration

The test suite is designed for CI/CD environments:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Run Comprehensive Tests
  run: |
    ./start-dev.sh &
    sleep 30  # Wait for services to start
    ./run-comprehensive-test-suite.sh
```

### Performance Baselines

Establish performance baselines for regression testing:
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Concurrent user capacity
- Mobile performance metrics

## Debugging Failed Tests

### Log Files

Test execution logs are saved to `/tmp/pitchey_test_*.log` files:
- Detailed output for each test suite
- Timestamped for easy identification
- Preserved for post-execution analysis

### Common Failure Patterns

1. **API Connectivity Issues**:
   - Check if API server is running
   - Verify port 8001 accessibility
   - Check authentication configuration

2. **Database Connection Problems**:
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - Check database credentials
   - Ensure database schema is current

3. **Performance Threshold Failures**:
   - May indicate system resource constraints
   - Check for competing processes
   - Consider adjusting thresholds for development environments

4. **Mobile/Responsive Issues**:
   - Often related to missing CSS frameworks
   - Check viewport meta tags
   - Verify responsive CSS is loaded

## Best Practices

### Test Execution

1. **Clean Environment**: Start with a clean database state
2. **Resource Availability**: Ensure adequate system resources
3. **Network Stability**: Stable network connection for API tests
4. **Timeouts**: Allow sufficient time for test completion

### Test Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**: Update tests when features change
2. **Threshold Adjustment**: Adjust performance thresholds based on infrastructure
3. **Data Management**: Regularly clean test data
4. **Documentation**: Keep this documentation current
