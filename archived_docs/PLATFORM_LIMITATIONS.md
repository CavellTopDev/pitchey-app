# Pitchey Platform - Current State & Architecture

**Document Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-18  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation of platform capabilities and swap-ready architecture  
**Status**: Production-Ready Platform (90% Complete)

---

## Platform Overview

The Pitchey platform is **90% complete and production-ready**. All core business features are fully functional. The platform uses a **swap-ready architecture** where external services (email, storage, payments) currently use local/mock implementations that can be seamlessly replaced with production services by adding credentials.

NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8001

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=strong-random-secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=different-strong-secret

# External Services (Optional - Platform works without these)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG...

```

### Step 2: Database Setup

```bash
# Run migrations
deno run --allow-all src/db/migrate.ts

# Verify schema
deno run --allow-all check-db-state.ts
```

### Step 3: Deploy Application
