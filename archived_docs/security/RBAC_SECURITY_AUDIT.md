# Security Audit Report: Pitch Creation Access Control

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Specialist  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Status:** RESOLVED ✓

## Executive Summary

A critical security vulnerability was identified where **investors and production companies could create, update, and delete pitches** despite the business requirement that only creators should have these permissions. This vulnerability has been successfully resolved through the implementation of comprehensive role-based access control (RBAC) across all pitch management endpoints.

## Vulnerability Details

### Issue Identified
- **Type:** Broken Access Control (OWASP Top 10 #1)
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Impact:** Business Logic Bypass, Data Integrity Risk
- **CVE Category:** CWE-285 (Improper Authorization)

### Affected Components
1. Backend API endpoints for pitch management
2. Draft synchronization endpoints
3. Pitch publishing and archiving endpoints

### Root Cause
Missing role-based authorization checks in critical pitch management endpoints allowed any authenticated user to perform creator-only operations.

## Security Implementation

### 1. Backend Access Control (✓ IMPLEMENTED)

#### Secured Endpoints
The following endpoints now enforce strict role-based access control:

**Creation Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/pitches` - Only creators allowed
- `POST /api/creator/pitches` - Only creators allowed

**Update Endpoints:**
- `PUT /api/pitches/{id}` - Only creators allowed
- `PUT /api/creator/pitches/{id}` - Only creators allowed

**Delete Endpoints:**
- `DELETE /api/pitches/{id}` - Only creators allowed
- `DELETE /api/creator/pitches/{id}` - Only creators allowed

**Publishing/Archiving:**
- `POST /api/creator/pitches/{id}/publish` - Only creators allowed
- `POST /api/creator/pitches/{id}/archive` - Only creators allowed

**Draft Operations:**
- `POST /api/drafts/{id}/autosave` - Only creators allowed
- `POST /api/drafts/{id}/save` - Only creators allowed

### 2. Security Controls Implemented

#### Role Validation
```typescript
// Example implementation
if (user.userType !== 'creator') {
  console.warn(`[SECURITY] User ${user.id} (${user.userType}) attempted unauthorized action`);
  return forbiddenResponse(
    `Access denied. Only creators can perform this action. Current role: ${user.userType}`
  );
}
```

#### Security Event Logging
- All unauthorized access attempts are logged to the `securityEvents` table
- Includes user ID, role, IP address, and attempted action
- Provides audit trail for compliance and monitoring

#### HTTP Response Codes
- **403 Forbidden** - Returned for unauthorized role-based access attempts
- Clear error messages indicating the required role
- No information leakage about system internals

### 3. Frontend Protection (✓ VERIFIED)

The frontend already implements proper role-based UI controls:
- "Create Pitch" button only visible to creators
- Routes protected with role checks
- Navigation dynamically adjusted based on user role

## Test Results

### Automated Testing
Created comprehensive test suite (`test-role-based-access-control.ts`) that validates:

| User Type | Create | Update | Delete | Draft | Result |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| Creator | ✓ Allowed | ✓ Allowed | ✓ Allowed | ✓ Allowed | PASS |
| Investor | ✗ Blocked | ✗ Blocked | ✗ Blocked | ✗ Blocked | PASS |
| Production | ✗ Blocked | ✗ Blocked | ✗ Blocked | ✗ Blocked | PASS |

### Security Events Captured
```
[SECURITY VIOLATION] User 2 (investor) attempted unauthorized pitch creation
[SECURITY VIOLATION] User 3 (production) attempted unauthorized pitch creation
```

## Compliance & Standards

### OWASP Top 10 Alignment
- **A01:2021 - Broken Access Control**: RESOLVED
- **A09:2021 - Security Logging**: IMPLEMENTED

### Security Headers Configuration
```typescript
// Recommended headers already in place
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (COMPLETED)
1. ✓ Implement role-based access control on all pitch endpoints
2. ✓ Add security event logging for audit trails
3. ✓ Return proper 403 responses with clear messages
4. ✓ Test all user roles against secured endpoints

### Future Enhancements
1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on pitch creation endpoints to prevent abuse
2. **IP Whitelisting**: Consider IP whitelisting for production company accounts
3. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Require 2FA for pitch deletion operations
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule quarterly security reviews
5. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct annual penetration testing

## Security Checklist

- [x] Role-based access control implemented
- [x] Security event logging active
- [x] Proper error responses (403 Forbidden)
- [x] No information leakage in error messages
- [x] Frontend UI controls match backend restrictions
- [x] Automated tests validate security controls
- [x] Audit trail for unauthorized attempts
- [x] Clear documentation of access matrix

## Access Control Matrix

| Feature | Creator | Investor | Production | Admin |
|---------|---------|----------|------------|-------|
| Create Pitch | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Update Pitch | ✓ (own) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Delete Pitch | ✓ (own) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| View Pitch | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Invest in Pitch | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Request NDA | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Save Draft | ✓ (own) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |

## Conclusion

The critical access control vulnerability has been successfully resolved. The implementation follows security best practices including:

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have necessary permissions
3. **Fail Secure**: System defaults to denying access
4. **Audit Logging**: All security events are tracked
5. **Clear Communication**: Error messages are informative but secure

The Pitchey platform now correctly enforces role-based access control, ensuring that only creators can create, update, and delete pitches while investors and production companies are limited to viewing and investing functions as per the business requirements.
