### Required Security Implementations
```typescript
// Media Access Control
middleware: [
  authenticateUser,
  checkNDAStatus,
  validateMediaAccess,
  logAccess
]

// API Security
middleware: [
  rateLimiter,
  validateInput,
  sanitizeOutput,
  auditLog
]
```

## Conclusion

The Pitchey platform has a well-designed frontend that clearly demonstrates the intended user experience and business value. However, significant backend development is required to make the platform operational and revenue-generating.

**Key Priorities**:
1. **Immediate**: Media upload/storage system (blocks core functionality)
2. **Critical**: Payment processing (blocks all revenue)
3. **Important**: Real-time messaging (affects user experience)
4. **Strategic**: AI features (competitive advantage)

**Estimated Time to MVP**: 6-8 weeks with focused development
**Estimated Time to Full Feature Set**: 10-12 weeks

The platform shows strong potential with clear monetization paths and well-defined user journeys. With the backend implementation completed, Pitchey could effectively serve its target market and generate revenue through multiple streams.
