# Workflow Validation Test Results

## Business Rules Implemented

### 1. Ownership Checking
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Users cannot request NDAs for their own pitches
- Frontend checks `pitch.creatorId === user.id` before making API calls
- Owners automatically get full access (`hasSignedNDA = true`)
- NDA modal is hidden for owners
- UI shows "Your Pitch" indicators

### 2. Portal Type Restrictions
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Only investors and production companies can request NDAs
- Frontend validates `user.userType` in `validateNDAAccess()`
- Creators get message: "Creators cannot request NDA access to other pitches"
- Only investors and production users see request buttons

### 3. Authentication Requirements
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Unauthenticated users cannot access NDA functionality
- No NDA status calls made for unauthenticated users
- Clear "Sign In to Request Access" button shown
- Backend returns proper "Authentication required" error

### 4. Error Handling
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Graceful handling of API errors
- 404/403 errors handled without console spam
- Network errors show retry buttons
- Loading states during API calls
- Clear error messages for users

### 5. UI/UX Improvements
✅ **IMPLEMENTED**: Better user feedback
- Loading spinners during NDA checks
- Clear access status indicators
- Color-coded status badges
- Context-aware action buttons
- Owner-specific UI enhancements
