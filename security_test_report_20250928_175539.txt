2. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
3. Implement proper session management with secure cookies
4. Enable all security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
5. Implement rate limiting on all sensitive endpoints
6. Use strong password policies and multi-factor authentication
7. Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities
8. Implement proper logging and monitoring
9. Use HTTPS everywhere with proper certificate validation
10. Implement least privilege principle for all user roles
