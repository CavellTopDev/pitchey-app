## Conclusion

The Investor Portal has a solid foundation with core authentication, basic pitch browsing, and investor-specific features partially implemented. However, several critical dashboard endpoints are missing, search functionality needs fixing, and comprehensive frontend testing is required.

**Priority:** Address the missing dashboard endpoints first, then fix search functionality, and finally implement the missing NDA action endpoints to provide a complete investor experience.

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days for critical fixes, additional 2-3 days for improvements and comprehensive testing.
