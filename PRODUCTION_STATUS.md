## Recent Deployment Activities (2025-10-05)

### ✅ Completed
1. **Fixed Environment Variables**
   - Updated `.env.deploy` with all required variables
   - Set optional services as empty to prevent errors
   - Added `FRONTEND_URL` for CORS configuration

2. **Manual Backend Deployment**
   - Successfully deployed using `deployctl` with manual token
   - Bypassed `.env.example` validation issue
   - Backend responding on new URL

3. **Frontend Update & Deployment**
   - Updated `netlify.toml` with new backend URL
   - Built frontend with correct API endpoint
   - Deployed to Netlify production

4. **GitHub Actions Fix**
   - Added OIDC permissions
   - Updated workflow to use manual token deployment
   - Added workaround for `.env.example` issue

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
   - Updated `DEPLOYMENT.md` with current URLs
   - Added deployment token to `.env.secrets` (gitignored)

## Configuration Status

### Environment Variables ✅
**Backend (Deno Deploy)**
- ✅ `DATABASE_URL` - Neon PostgreSQL connection
- ✅ `JWT_SECRET` - Authentication secret
- ✅ `FRONTEND_URL` - CORS configuration
- ⏸️ Optional services set as empty (Redis, Email, S3, Stripe)

**Frontend (Netlify)**
- ✅ `VITE_API_URL` - Points to correct backend

### GitHub Secrets ✅
- ✅ `DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN` - Added to repository secrets

### Deployment Pipeline ⚠️
- ✅ Tests passing in GitHub Actions
- ⚠️ Auto-deployment fixed but needs testing
- ✅ Manual deployment working

## Test Results

### Authentication ✅
```bash
# Creator Login - WORKING
curl -X POST https://pitchey-backend-fresh-23jvxyy3bspp.deno.dev/api/auth/creator/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"alex.creator@demo.com","password":"Demo123"}'
```

### Demo Accounts (All Working)
| Role | Email | Password | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Creator | alex.creator@demo.com | Demo123 | ✅ |
| Investor | sarah.investor@demo.com | Demo123 | ✅ |
| Production | stellar.production@demo.com | Demo123 | ✅ |

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **GitHub Actions Mode**
   - Deno Deploy project not configured for GitHub Actions mode
   - Using manual token deployment as workaround

2. **Optional Services**
   - Redis caching not configured (using in-memory)
   - Email service not configured (Resend)
   - File storage not configured (S3)
   - Payment processing not configured (Stripe)

3. **PWA Score**
   - Low PWA score (30/100) - not optimized for offline/installable

## Next Steps Priority

### Immediate (Today)
- [x] Test GitHub Actions deployment with next commit
- [ ] Monitor production for errors
- [ ] Test all demo account workflows

### This Week
- [ ] Configure Redis for distributed caching
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry/LogRocket)
- [ ] Add health check monitoring

### Later
- [ ] Add email service (Resend)
- [ ] Configure file storage (S3/R2)
- [ ] Implement payment processing (Stripe)
- [ ] Improve PWA capabilities

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check backend health
curl https://pitchey-backend-fresh-23jvxyy3bspp.deno.dev/api/health

# Test authentication
curl -X POST https://pitchey-backend-fresh-23jvxyy3bspp.deno.dev/api/auth/creator/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"alex.creator@demo.com","password":"Demo123"}'
