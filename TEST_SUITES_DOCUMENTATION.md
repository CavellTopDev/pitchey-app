# Comprehensive Test Suites Documentation

This document describes the two comprehensive test suites created for the Pitchey application to ensure production readiness and data integrity.

## Test Suites Overview

### 1. test-environment-variables.sh
**Purpose**: Validates all environment variable configurations across different environments

**Key Features**:
- Tests 60+ environment variables for proper configuration
- Environment-specific validation (development/staging/production)
- Security checks for weak secrets and insecure defaults
- Configuration consistency validation
- Hardcoded value detection
- URL format validation
- Numeric range validation
- Documentation completeness checks

**Usage**:
```bash
# Test current environment (auto-detects from DENO_ENV)
./test-environment-variables.sh

# Test specific environment
./test-environment-variables.sh production
./test-environment-variables.sh development
./test-environment-variables.sh staging
```

**Exit Codes**:
- 0: All tests passed
- 1: Critical failures (immediate action required)
- 2: Security concerns (review recommended)
- 3: Configuration issues detected

### 2. test-demo-data-cleanup.sh
**Purpose**: Ensures demo/mock data doesn't reach production and validates data isolation

**Key Features**:
- Source code scanning for demo data patterns
- Database demo account detection
- Hardcoded response analysis
- Mock data function identification
- API response validation
- Configuration file scanning
- Test file detection
- Upload directory cleanup
- Security risk assessment
- Auto-generation of cleanup scripts

**Usage**:
```bash
# Test current environment
./test-demo-data-cleanup.sh

# Test specific environment
./test-demo-data-cleanup.sh production
./test-demo-data-cleanup.sh development
```

**Exit Codes**:
- 0: Demo data status acceptable
- 1: Critical demo data issues (immediate cleanup required)
- 2: Demo data in production (cleanup recommended)
- 3: Security concerns (review required)

- BASE_URL (links base URL)

### Feature Flags
- NDA_EXPIRATION_SERVICE
- USE_LOCAL_FALLBACK
- MIGRATION_BATCH_SIZE

## Demo Data Patterns Detected

### Email Patterns
- `*.demo.com` addresses
- `*.example.com` addresses
- `test@*` addresses
- Known demo accounts (alex.creator@demo.com, etc.)

### Content Patterns
- Hardcoded view counts (1250, 15k, etc.)
- Hardcoded follower counts (892, etc.)
- Lorem ipsum placeholder text
- "TODO" and "placeholder" content
- Demo passwords (Demo123, password123)

### Code Patterns
- Mock data functions
- Hardcoded API responses
- Test data generation functions
- Development-only configurations

### File Patterns
- Test upload files
- Demo data files
- Mock configuration files
- Seed data scripts

## Security Checks Performed

### Environment Variables Security
- JWT secret strength (minimum 32 characters)
- No default/weak secrets in production
- No localhost URLs in production
- Proper SSL configuration for databases
- Stripe key environment matching

### Demo Data Security
- No demo credentials in production documentation
- No demo accounts in production database
- No test passwords in production
- No hardcoded analytics values

### Configuration Security
- .env files excluded from git
- No production credentials in development
- Proper HTTPS enforcement in production
- Secure cookie configuration

## Production Readiness Checklist

### Environment Variables
- [ ] All required variables set for production
- [ ] Strong, unique secrets generated
- [ ] Database uses SSL/TLS connections
- [ ] File storage configured for cloud
- [ ] Email service properly configured
- [ ] Monitoring and logging enabled

### Demo Data Cleanup
- [ ] All demo accounts removed
- [ ] No hardcoded analytics values
- [ ] No test/placeholder content
- [ ] Documentation doesn't expose credentials
- [ ] Upload directories cleaned
- [ ] Environment variables use production values
- [ ] Database contains only real user data

## Recommendations

### Development Environment
1. Create and maintain `.env.example` file
2. Use local database for development
3. Keep demo accounts for testing
4. Clearly mark test data
5. Avoid production API calls

### Staging Environment
1. Mirror production configuration
2. Use staging-specific credentials
3. Test with production-like data
4. Validate environment transitions
5. Run both test suites before promotion

### Production Environment
1. Remove all demo/test data
2. Use strong, unique secrets
3. Enable all security features
4. Monitor for demo data reintroduction
5. Regular security audits

## Integration with CI/CD

Both scripts can be integrated into your deployment pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Validate Environment Variables
  run: ./test-environment-variables.sh production
  
- name: Check Demo Data Cleanup
  run: ./test-demo-data-cleanup.sh production
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database connection failures**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is accessible
2. **Deno not found**: Scripts work with or without Deno
3. **Permission denied**: Run `chmod +x test-*.sh`
4. **False positives**: Review patterns and adjust for your use case

### Script Customization
Both scripts are designed to be easily customizable:
- Modify patterns in the arrays at the top of each function
- Add environment-specific checks
- Adjust severity levels for different findings
- Extend database queries for your schema

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates Needed
1. Update environment variable lists as new features are added
2. Add new demo data patterns discovered
3. Update database queries for schema changes
4. Review and update security thresholds

### Monitoring
- Run scripts before each production deployment
- Include in regular security audits
- Monitor for new types of demo data introduction
- Track script execution results over time

Both test suites provide comprehensive coverage for production readiness and should be run before any production deployment to ensure data integrity and security compliance.
