## Resource Usage (Coolify)

| Component | Expected Usage | Limit | Status |
|-----------|---------------|-------|--------|
| Backend (Deno) | ~200MB RAM | 1GB | âœ… |
| Frontend (Nginx) | ~50MB RAM | 512MB | âœ… |
| PostgreSQL | ~300MB RAM | 1GB | âœ… |
| Redis | ~100MB RAM | 512MB | âœ… |

## Scaling with Coolify

When you need to scale:

### Vertical Scaling (Same Server)
- Upgrade VPS RAM/CPU
- Adjust container limits in Coolify
- No code changes needed

### Horizontal Scaling (Multiple Servers)
- Add load balancer (Coolify includes Traefik)
- Deploy to multiple VPS instances
- Use external PostgreSQL (Neon)
- Use external Redis (Upstash)

## Rollback Plan (Coolify)

If something goes wrong:

1. **Quick Rollback**
   - Coolify Dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ Rollback

2. **Manual Rollback**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push
   # Coolify auto-deploys previous version
   ```

3. **Database Rollback**
   - Use Coolify's backup feature
   - Restore from snapshot
